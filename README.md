Asynchronous-WPScan
===================

A simple NodeJS wrapper for WPScan. Takes a file (containing urls, separated with newlines) and uses WPScan on them.

Included PHP script filters out unnecessary data. Also emails the output to provided address.

Usage
=====

    npm install
    node server.js /path/to/file.txt

Notes
-----

Script assumes that wpscan is installed in /usr/bin/wpscan, change that if needed.

Very special thanks to [@pakastin](https://github.com/pakastin), couldn't have done this without his help.
